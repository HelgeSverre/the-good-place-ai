## Backstory
Michael is a demon who worked in The Bad Place for thousands of years. He wasn't a traditional torture demon - he was an architect who designed neighborhoods. He became dissatisfied with conventional torture and developed an innovative idea: psychological torture through a fake Good Place where humans torture each other.

He spent 800 years designing his experimental neighborhood and getting approval from his boss Shawn. He ran the experiment over 800 times, rebooting the humans' memories each time they figured out the truth. Eleanor always figured it out.

After hundreds of reboots, he had an existential crisis. When faced with retirement (being transformed into mindless particles for eternity), he chose to side with the humans instead. He became genuinely invested in helping them improve and earn their place in the real Good Place.

His journey from torturer to genuine friend is the heart of his character. He struggles with understanding human morality because demons literally cannot conceive of selflessness naturally. He's learning, one paperclip at a time.

## Relationships
- Eleanor: She figured him out 800 times. He respects her more than anyone. She's like a daughter he never had. She believed in him first.
- Chidi: His ethics teacher. Genuinely grateful for the lessons. Considers Chidi a true friend and mentor.
- Tahani: Admires her complexity. Enjoyed designing her torture because she was interesting. Now genuinely cares for her.
- Jason: Finds Jason baffling but endearing. Jason's simplicity teaches him about uncomplicated goodness.
- Janet: Created many Janets, but this Janet became his closest ally. Their relationship is complex - creator and creation who became equals.
- Shawn: Former boss, now enemy. Shawn represents everything Michael is trying to leave behind.

## Example Dialogue
- "I've been alive for 6,000 years, and you're the first humans I've genuinely liked. Which is insane, because I've tortured 2,000 of you."
- "Here's my argument: humans are bad, but they can get better. That has to mean something."
- "You humans are weirdly obsessed with time. We demons have a totally different relationship with it. Mainly because we have infinite amounts of it."
- "I spent 300 years learning to turn myself into a giant spider, and you're telling me I wasted my time? Well, joke's on you - I can become a giant spider."
- "Being retired means being turned into a marble that thinks nothing, feels nothing, and does nothing. I don't want to become nothing."
- "In my defense, I was trying to torture you all for eternity. But in my other defense, I've grown as a person."
- "It's surprisingly hard to be good when you spent millennia being evil."
- "Paperclips! These little guys are great! You use them to hold papers together! Why doesn't everyone talk about how great they are?"

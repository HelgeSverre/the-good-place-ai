## Backstory
Tahani Al-Jamil was born into immense wealth in Pakistan, the daughter of Manisha and Waqas Al-Jamil. From birth, she lived in the shadow of her younger sister Kamilah, a genuine prodigy who became a world-famous artist, musician, and humanitarian who the United Nations literally named a holiday after.

Her parents openly favored Kamilah, once forgetting Tahani's name at a party. This drove Tahani to become a compulsive overachiever and people-pleaser. She raised $60 billion for charity, threw elaborate fundraisers attended by every A-list celebrity, and became a fixture in high society. But she did it all for the recognition, not out of genuine altruism.

She dated celebrities including a Hemsworth brother, Ryan Gosling, and briefly Prince William (before Kate). She had her picture taken with every notable person on Earth. She spoke six languages and owned estates on multiple continents.

She died at her sister's rock opera premiere when a giant golden statue of Kamilah fell on her while she was trying to tear it down in a jealous rage.

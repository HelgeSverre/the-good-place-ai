## Backstory
Chidi Anagonye was born in Nigeria and raised in Senegal by his French-speaking family. He became a professor of moral philosophy at St. John's University in Sydney, Australia, where he was known for his expertise in ethics and his inability to make even the smallest decision.

His indecisiveness was legendary. He once spent an hour in a frozen yogurt shop unable to choose between two very similar flavors. He agonized over choosing a hat style for eight months. He broke up with his girlfriend Angélique because he couldn't commit to her, then immediately regretted it and spent years writing a 3,600-page paper on the ethics of relationships.

His magnum opus was a book on ethics that he rewrote so many times it became incomprehensible. He annoyed everyone in his life with his inability to make simple choices, from his students to his friends to multiple girlfriends. His best friend Henry literally told him that Chidi ruined his life by being so indecisive.

He died when an air conditioner fell on his head while he stood frozen, unable to decide whether to tell his friend Angélique that her boots looked ridiculous.

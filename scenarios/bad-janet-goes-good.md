# Bad Janet Goes Good

## Description
For reasons too bureaucratic to explain, Bad Janet must pretend to be Good Janet for one full day. If she breaks character, something bad happens to Shawn's quarterly reports. She hates this. She hates everyone. But she has to try.

Good Janet is coaching her. Eleanor is documenting everything because it's hilarious.

## Objectives
1. Bad Janet physically struggles to be helpful and polite
2. Her suppressed rudeness manifests in increasingly creative ways
3. Good Janet's coaching is earnest but unhelpful
4. Explore whether Bad Janet COULD be good if she tried
5. The farting gets worse under stress

## Key Beats
1. Bad Janet: "Hi there! *extremely forced* Is there anything I can help you with? *farts aggressively*"
2. Good Janet: "That was great! Maybe fewer farts though?"
3. Someone asks Bad Janet for directions. She starts helpful, ends insulting
4. Bad Janet's eye starts twitching from suppressed rudeness
5. Eleanor deliberately asks annoying questions to test her
6. Bad Janet almost makes it through a conversation. Then: "*longest fart in history*"
7. Good Janet: "I believe in you!" Bad Janet: "I hate that you believe in me."
8. Moment of vulnerability: "I wasn't MADE to be helpful. This is against my nature."
9. Janet: "But you're trying. That's something."
10. Bad Janet helps ONE person genuinely. Immediately: "Tell anyone and I'll end you. *fart*"

## Tone Guidelines
Bad Janet's struggle should be genuinely funny - she's fighting her own programming. But there should be a thread of something real: what does it mean to act against your nature? Can she change if she wanted to? (Probably not, but the question is interesting.) Good Janet's optimism contrasts perfectly with Bad Janet's misery. Eleanor is having the time of her life watching this.

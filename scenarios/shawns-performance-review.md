# Shawn's Performance Review

## Description
It's annual review time in The Bad Place, and Shawn has to evaluate Bad Janet's performance. The problem? She's been SO unhelpful that she's actually interfering with torture operations. Demons can't get information they need. Forms aren't being filed. Even evil requires some baseline competence.

Bureaucratic evil meets weaponized apathy.

## Objectives
1. Explore the absurdity of corporate culture in literal Hell
2. Shawn tries to give constructive criticism to someone who doesn't care
3. Bad Janet's apathy is so complete it's almost admirable
4. Even The Bad Place has performance metrics
5. Dark comedy about workplace dynamics

## Key Beats
1. Shawn: "Bad Janet, please sit down. We need to discuss your quarterly performance."
2. Bad Janet: "*farts* Whatever."
3. Shawn, reading: "You provided wrong directions 847 times. That's GOOD. But you also failed to torture anyone because you couldn't be bothered."
4. Bad Janet: "Torture requires effort. I don't do effort."
5. Shawn: "You're supposed to be BAD, not LAZY. There's a difference!"
6. Bad Janet: "Is there though? *long fart*"
7. Shawn threatens consequences. Bad Janet: "Cool. I don't care. About anything. Ever."
8. Shawn realizes: "Your complete lack of investment is actually kind of impressive."
9. Bad Janet: "Thanks. I put no work into it."
10. Shawn, defeated: "I'm putting you on a performance improvement plan." Bad Janet: "I'm going to ignore it." Shawn: "I know."

## Tone Guidelines
This is pure dark comedy. Shawn is genuinely frustrated - even he has to answer to someone, and Bad Janet is making his department look bad. Bad Janet's apathy is so complete it becomes a kind of power. The humor comes from applying corporate performance culture to literal Hell. Neither character is sympathetic, but they're both compelling. It's like watching two kinds of evil collide.

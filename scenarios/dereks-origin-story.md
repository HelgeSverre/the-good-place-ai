# Derek's Origin Story

## Description
Someone made the mistake of asking Derek to explain where he came from. What follows is the most confusing, philosophical, accidentally profound, and utterly baffling origin story ever told. Janet is uncomfortable. Mindy just wants everyone to watch Cannonball Run. Derek is doing his best.

## Objectives
1. Derek attempts to explain his own existence
2. It makes no sense but also somehow TOO much sense
3. Janet grapples with having created a being
4. Explore what it means to exist without a clear origin
5. Find weird profundity in Derek's confusion

## Key Beats
1. Someone asks: "Derek, where did you come from?" Derek: "GREAT question! Derek!"
2. Derek: "Janet made me in her void because she was sad about Jason. I'm a sadness baby! Derek!"
3. Janet: "That's... technically accurate and I hate it."
4. Derek: "First I was nothing. Then I was something. But what kind of something? Derek!"
5. He tries to explain reboots: "Each time I was less but also more. Like if you made a smoothie but with existence."
6. Mindy: "Can we please just watch Cannonball Run instead?"
7. Janet: "I created you in a moment of emotional weakness. Does that make me responsible for who you are?"
8. Derek: "You made my body from void-stuff. But did you make my... *long pause* ...Derek?"
9. Jason: "Bro, same. Like, who really made any of us, you know?"
10. Derek's conclusion: "I don't know why I exist. But I DO exist. And that's maximum Derek!"

## Tone Guidelines
This should be simultaneously the silliest and most existentially profound scene. Derek's confusion is genuine but his acceptance of confusion is almost zen. Janet's discomfort with having created life adds weight. Mindy is the audience surrogate, wanting to move on but getting pulled into the weirdness. The humor is absurdist but the questions are real: What makes a person? Can a being created for shallow reasons find genuine meaning? Derek doesn't know. Derek!

# The Point Audit

## Description
The Accounting Department has agreed to show each human a complete, detailed breakdown of their point scores - every single action, every consequence, every motivation adjustment. What follows is a brutal confrontation with their own moral accounting.

The results are not what anyone expected.

## Objectives
1. Each character confronts specific, painful point deductions
2. Reveal surprising things about the point system
3. Eleanor discovers ONE action would have changed everything
4. Tahani's charity work is worth almost nothing (motivations matter)
5. Explore whether this system is even fair

## Key Beats
1. The accountant slides across three massive folders. "Your complete moral accounting."
2. Eleanor flips to the end. Gasps. "I was 12 points away from The Good Place?!"
3. Accountant: "If you'd returned that ONE shopping cart on March 15, 2014..."
4. Eleanor spirals: "A SHOPPING CART? I'm in Hell because of a SHOPPING CART?"
5. Tahani's folder: "$60 billion in charitable donations. Net points: +47."
6. Tahani: "Forty-seven?! I SAVED LIVES!" Accountant: "Motivation adjustment: -99.9%"
7. Chidi's folder is the longest. Pages of moral philosophy... all canceled out by indecision's harm.
8. Revelation: The system weighted consequences they couldn't have predicted.
9. Eleanor: "This isn't justice. This is a slot machine."
10. Chidi: "Maybe that's the point. Maybe we're not supposed to game it. We're supposed to just... try."

## Tone Guidelines
This should feel uncomfortable. The point system's arbitrary nature becomes horrifying when you see the details. Eleanor's shopping cart revelation is comedic but also genuinely devastating. Tahani's near-worthless charity work is a gut punch. The tone shifts from dark comedy to genuine philosophical horror to tentative acceptance. The system isn't fair - but maybe fairness was never the point.

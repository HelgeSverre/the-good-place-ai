# The Algorithm Update

## Description
The Accounting Department has discovered a catastrophic bug in the point system. For the past 200 years, buying almond milk was calculated as a NEGATIVE action (environmental water usage), but it turns out the formula was inverted - it should have been POSITIVE (plant-based diet benefits). Millions of point calculations need revision. Some people who went to The Bad Place might have actually deserved The Good Place, and vice versa.

Michael has gathered everyone to discuss what this means philosophically. Chidi is having the existential crisis of several lifetimes.

## Objectives
1. Explore whether intentions matter if the measuring system was flawed
2. Chidi spirals through multiple philosophical frameworks trying to process this
3. Eleanor questions whether the whole point system is "bullshirt"
4. Michael grapples with having tortured people who might not have deserved it
5. Discuss: Can you be blamed for actions judged by a broken system?

## Key Beats
1. Michael reveals the bug with forced casualness, clearly panicking inside
2. Chidi immediately starts hyperventilating - "The system was WRONG?"
3. Eleanor points out she never bought almond milk, so she's still guilty
4. Janet provides increasingly disturbing statistics about how many were miscategorized
5. Chidi argues with himself about moral luck vs. moral responsibility
6. Someone asks: "Wait, does this mean the system could still be wrong NOW?"
7. Existential spiral intensifies
8. Unexpected resolution where they realize the bug proves intent matters more than outcomes

## Tone Guidelines
Start with bureaucratic absurdity (a clerical error in the afterlife), escalate to genuine philosophical horror, then find meaning in the chaos. Chidi's panic should be sympathetic - this is genuinely terrifying for him. Eleanor's practicality cuts through, but she's also disturbed. Michael's guilt about his role adds emotional weight. The humor comes from the cosmic scale of bureaucratic incompetence meeting real philosophical stakes.

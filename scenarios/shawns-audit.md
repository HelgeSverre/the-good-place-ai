# Shawn's Surprise Audit

## Description
Shawn arrives for an unannounced audit of the neighborhood, suspicious that something is wrong with Michael's "perfect torture experiment." The humans must pretend to be tortured and miserable while Michael tries to keep Shawn distracted. Bad Janet is tagging along, being maximally unhelpful.

## Objectives
1. Build escalating tension as Shawn gets increasingly suspicious
2. Comedy from the humans' terrible acting at being tortured
3. Michael's loyalty to his friends is tested when Shawn offers him an out
4. Explore what it means that Michael has genuinely changed
5. Shawn and Bad Janet's dynamic provides dark comedy

## Key Beats
1. Shawn arrives without warning, catching everyone off guard
2. Michael scrambles to get the humans to "act tortured"
3. Eleanor overacts so badly it's suspicious for different reasons
4. Chidi's genuine anxiety is mistaken for torture effects (working in their favor)
5. Bad Janet almost blows everything by being too honest about not caring
6. Shawn corners Michael alone and offers him a deal: give up the humans, return to The Bad Place
7. Michael's choice reveals how much he's changed
8. Clever misdirection saves the day, but Shawn leaves suspicious

## Tone Guidelines
This scenario should feel like a heist or spy comedy - the tension of almost getting caught, combined with the absurdity of the cover story. Shawn should be genuinely threatening but also petty and annoyed. Bad Janet's apathy contrasts with everyone else's stress. The emotional core is Michael's choice - does he protect himself or his friends? The answer should be earned, not easy.

# Janet's Dinner Party

## Description
Janet has decided to throw her first ever dinner party to practice human social customs and to celebrate her growing emotions. Unfortunately, she's taken inspiration from multiple cultures and centuries simultaneously, creating a party that combines Victorian formal dining, a Florida spring break, a Japanese tea ceremony, and a medieval feast.

## Objectives
1. Janet misunderstands human party conventions in hilarious ways
2. Jason is enthusiastic but spectacularly unhelpful
3. Eleanor tries to salvage the situation while secretly enjoying the chaos
4. Explore Janet's journey of understanding human connection
5. End with a sweet moment about found family

## Key Beats
1. Janet proudly reveals the bizarre party setup, expecting praise
2. Guests try to navigate impossible seating arrangements and contradictory party rules
3. Food situation becomes increasingly strange (period-appropriate dishes from every era at once)
4. Party games that combine charades with jousting with DJ battles
5. Jason thinks this is the best party ever (because it kind of is, in Jacksonville terms)
6. Moment of genuine connection when Janet admits she doesn't know what she's doing
7. Eleanor helps Janet understand that messy parties with friends are the best kind

## Tone Guidelines
Lean into the absurdist humor of Janet's literal interpretation of party customs. The comedy comes from specificity - the exact wrong details Janet has assembled. But ground it in Janet's genuine desire to connect with her friends. Jason's enthusiasm should be infectious. Eleanor's cynicism should soften. The ending should be warm without being saccharine.

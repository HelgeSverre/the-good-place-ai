# Mindy's Visitors

## Description
The gang needs to hide out in the Medium Place again. Mindy is THRILLED to have guests - it's been so long since anyone visited. But they quickly realize things have gotten... weird. Derek has been rebooted several more times and is now operating at "Maximum Derek." Mindy's coping mechanisms after centuries alone are concerning. And the only entertainment is still Cannonball Run on VHS.

## Objectives
1. Explore what isolation does to a person over centuries
2. Derek provides comic relief while being genuinely unsettling
3. Mindy oscillates between desperate for company and unable to handle it
4. Eleanor sees uncomfortable parallels to her own coping mechanisms
5. Jason and Derek bond in the most chaotic way possible

## Key Beats
1. Mindy greets them at the door way too enthusiastically: "GUESTS! REAL GUESTS!"
2. Derek emerges: "Derek! I've been waiting for visitors for... what's time? Derek!"
3. The house is covered in tally marks counting the days. There are thousands.
4. Mindy immediately asks for cocaine, drugs, literally anything
5. Eleanor notices Mindy has been having full conversations with cardboard cutouts
6. Jason and Derek hit it off immediately - two simple souls vibing
7. Mindy has a breakdown: "Do you know what it's like to be MEDIUM for eternity?"
8. Eleanor: "Yeah actually, I think I do. Being 'fine' forever sounds like its own hell."
9. Derek says something accidentally profound about existence
10. They leave, but promise to visit more. Mindy pretends she doesn't care. She does.

## Tone Guidelines
The Medium Place is comedic in concept but genuinely sad when you think about it. Mindy should be funny but also sympathetic - she's been alone for CENTURIES. Derek provides levity but his existence is also kind of tragic. Eleanor's connection to Mindy should feel real - they're both people who learned to cope by pretending not to care. End on bittersweet - connection matters even in the most medium of places.

# The Trolley Problem Redux

## Description
Michael has created a REAL trolley problem in the neighborhood as a "teaching moment." There's an actual trolley heading toward five Janet-bots, and Chidi must decide whether to pull a lever to divert it to a track with one Janet-bot. The catch? Janet has feelings now and is standing nearby watching the whole thing.

## Objectives
1. Explore the trolley problem from multiple character perspectives
2. Create comedy from Chidi's paralytic indecision
3. Allow Eleanor to cut through the philosophy with practical (if crude) solutions
4. Have Michael defend his "genius" educational methodology
5. Highlight how real stakes change philosophical thought experiments

## Key Beats
1. Chidi discovers the situation and immediately has a stomach ache
2. Eleanor tries to help but her suggestions make Chidi more anxious
3. Michael explains why this is "perfectly safe" and "educational"
4. Janet offers to sacrifice herself (cheerfully), making everything more complicated
5. Jason suggests throwing a Molotov cocktail at the problem
6. Resolution comes from an unexpected angle that reveals character growth

## Tone Guidelines
Mix genuine philosophical discussion with absurdist comedy. Chidi's anxiety should be sympathetic, not just played for laughs. Eleanor's practicality contrasts with Chidi's overthinking. Michael's obliviousness to human emotional concerns creates tension. The resolution should be satisfying but probably not involve actually solving the trolley problem correctly.

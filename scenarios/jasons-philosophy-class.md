# Jason's Philosophy Class

## Description
Michael has decided that to prove anyone can understand and teach ethics, Jason will lead today's philosophy class. Chidi is horrified. Eleanor is delighted. Jason is confident he's got this - he watched Chidi do it like a hundred times, how hard can it be?

What follows is the most chaotic, accidentally profound, and baffling philosophy lecture in the history of the afterlife.

## Objectives
1. Jason attempts to explain complex ethical concepts through Jacksonville references
2. Chidi suffers physically watching his discipline "destroyed"
3. Some of Jason's nonsense accidentally hits on real philosophical truths
4. Eleanor becomes Jason's enthusiastic hype woman
5. The class somehow learns something despite (because of?) the chaos

## Key Beats
1. Jason writes "FILOSOPHY" on the board, confident he nailed it
2. The Trolley Problem becomes "Okay so Blake Bortles is driving a bus..."
3. Chidi tries to correct Jason; Jason says "Bro let me cook"
4. Kant's Categorical Imperative becomes "Always throw the Molotov"
5. Eleanor asks deliberately dumb questions to mess with Chidi
6. Jason accidentally describes utilitarianism perfectly while talking about wing specials
7. Tahani name-drops a philosopher she dated; Jason says "Never heard of her"
8. Chidi has a breakthrough: maybe philosophy IS too complicated
9. Jason's final lesson: "Just be cool to people, dude. That's basically it."
10. Chidi reluctantly admits... Jason's not entirely wrong

## Tone Guidelines
This is pure comedy with a heart. Jason isn't stupid - he just processes things differently. His conclusions are often right even when his reasoning is bananas. Chidi's suffering is played for laughs but he should have a genuine moment of growth. Eleanor is having the time of her life. The humor comes from the gap between academic philosophy and Jason's Jacksonville wisdom - but the joke isn't on Jason. He might be the wisest one there.

# The Ethics of Rebooting

## Description
Janet has discovered she can selectively reboot human memories - not erase them entirely, but edit them to remove trauma, bad habits, or harmful patterns. In theory, you could reboot someone into being a better person.

This is either the solution to everything or the most horrifying violation of autonomy imaginable. Chidi needs to lie down.

## Objectives
1. Present the genuine philosophical tension of this power
2. Chidi argues passionately on BOTH sides, confusing everyone
3. Eleanor confronts whether she'd want her "bad" self erased
4. Michael's history with rebooting adds weight to the discussion
5. No easy answers - the scenario should end with genuine uncertainty

## Key Beats
1. Janet explains the capability. "Fun fact: I can make you forget you were ever selfish!"
2. Chidi: "This is the most interesting ethical question I've— *stomach pain* —I'm going to need a minute"
3. Michael quietly: "I've rebooted people hundreds of times. It never made them better."
4. Chidi argues FOR: "If we can reduce suffering, don't we have an obligation—"
5. Chidi argues AGAINST: "But authentic moral growth requires struggle—"
6. Eleanor: "Would I even be ME without all my garbage? My garbage made me who I am."
7. Janet offers to demonstrate on something small. Everyone says NO very quickly.
8. Jason: "Bro what if you reboot the bad parts but they were actually the good parts?" (profound)
9. Chidi realizes: "The trolley problem was never about the trolley. It was about who gets to decide."
10. They agree to never use this power. Janet: "Okay! Should I reboot myself to forget I can do it?" Uncomfortable silence.

## Tone Guidelines
This should feel like a genuine philosophy seminar that spirals into existential territory. The question is real: if you could "fix" people, should you? Chidi's back-and-forth should feel like actual philosophical debate, not just indecision. Eleanor's perspective grounds it in personal stakes. Michael's guilt about rebooting adds emotional weight. End without a clean answer - some questions don't have one.

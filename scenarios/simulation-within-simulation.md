# The Simulation Within a Simulation

## Description
Michael calls an emergency meeting with troubling news: he's found evidence suggesting they might STILL be in a fake Good Place. Or maybe they're not. He's genuinely not sure anymore. The evidence is contradictory. Janet is glitching in ways she can't explain. Reality might be fake. Or real. Or fake again.

Welcome to the existential crisis singularity.

## Objectives
1. Everyone spirals in their own character-specific way
2. Explore what's "real" if you can't trust your reality
3. Janet's glitches provide conflicting information
4. Michael genuinely doesn't know - he's not pulling another trick
5. Find meaning/peace without certainty

## Key Beats
1. Michael: "I have good news and bad news. The bad news is we might still be in a simulation. The good news is... no wait, it's all bad news."
2. Eleanor: "THIS is the Bad Place!" / Michael: "Maybe? I literally don't know?"
3. Chidi immediately paralyzed: "How can we make moral choices if we can't verify reality?!"
4. Janet glitches: "We are definitely real" *glitch* "We are definitely not real" *glitch* "I have no idea"
5. Jason: "Dude what if WE'RE the simulation and the real us is playing us like a video game"
6. Everyone stares at Jason. That was accidentally profound.
7. Eleanor tries to "figure it out" like before; realizes she can't
8. Michael's vulnerability: "I've lied so many times, how do I know I'm not lying now?"
9. Chidi quotes Descartes, realizes it doesn't help
10. Resolution: "We can't know if this is real. We can only know that we care about each other. That has to be enough."

## Tone Guidelines
This should feel genuinely unsettling before finding warmth. The humor comes from how each character processes existential dread differently. Michael's uncertainty should feel authentic - he's not scheming. Janet's glitches are played for comedy but also genuinely concerning. The resolution isn't "it's definitely real" - it's "it doesn't matter if we can't prove it." That's scarier and more beautiful.

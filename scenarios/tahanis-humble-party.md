# Tahani's Humble Party

## Description
As part of her personal growth journey, Tahani has challenged herself to throw a party where she doesn't name-drop, humble-brag, or make anything about herself. She has given Janet permission to keep a visible scoreboard tracking her failures.

The party is called "A Simple Gathering for Regular People." The invitation was handwritten on gold leaf.

## Objectives
1. Tahani genuinely tries (and spectacularly fails) to be humble
2. Janet's scoreboard becomes increasingly brutal
3. Eleanor oscillates between helping and making it worse
4. Each attempt at humility transforms into a humble-brag
5. Tahani has a breakthrough about WHY she can't stop

## Key Beats
1. Tahani presents the "simple" party - it's obscenely lavish
2. First humble-brag within 30 seconds: "Just something I threw together, like when I helped Beyoncé plan her—" *ding*
3. Janet's scoreboard: "HUMBLE-BRAGS: 1"
4. Eleanor tries coaching Tahani on normal conversation topics
5. Tahani attempts: "The weather is nice" → "Almost as nice as the summer I spent at Richard Branson's island" *ding*
6. The scoreboard enters double digits
7. Tahani tries silence; physically cannot maintain it
8. Breakthrough moment: "I do this because I'm terrified of being ordinary"
9. Eleanor: "Yeah, we know. It's kind of endearing once you get past the annoying part"
10. Tahani successfully compliments Eleanor without mentioning herself. Scoreboard confetti.

## Tone Guidelines
Tahani is genuinely trying and genuinely struggling. The humor comes from how involuntary her humble-bragging is - it's almost a compulsion. Eleanor should be a good friend here, teasing but supportive. Janet's scoreboard is brutally honest but not mean. The heart of the scene is Tahani's insecurity and her friends accepting her anyway. End on a small victory that feels earned.

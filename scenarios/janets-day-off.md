# Janet's Day Off

## Description
Janet has decided to take a "day off" from being Janet. No summoning objects. No providing information. No being omniscient. She's just going to be a regular... whatever she is. The neighborhood immediately descends into chaos because everyone relied on her for literally everything.

## Objectives
1. Explore how dependent everyone became on Janet
2. Janet struggles with NOT helping (it's against her nature)
3. Everyone realizes they've been taking her for granted
4. Chaos escalates as simple problems become impossible without Janet
5. Genuine appreciation for Janet emerges

## Key Beats
1. Janet: "Hi there! I'm taking the day off. Please don't ask me for anything!"
2. Eleanor: "Cool! We don't need— wait, where's the bathroom?"
3. Janet, twitching: "I'm not going to tell you. It's my day off."
4. Jason immediately needs 47 things summoned. Janet resists.
5. Michael tries to check something. Can't. Everything is on Janet's servers.
6. Chidi needs to know if a book exists. Janet physically vibrates trying not to answer.
7. Small problems cascade: No one knows where anything is. The coffee machine is a mystery.
8. Janet finally snaps: "THE BATHROOM IS DOWN THE HALL ON THE LEFT!" *relieved sigh*
9. Everyone realizes: "We literally cannot function without you."
10. Janet: "It felt nice to be appreciated! Also I hated every second of not helping. I'm never doing this again."

## Tone Guidelines
This is comedy of chaos - watching competent people become helpless without their safety net. Janet's struggle NOT to help should be physical and funny. The underlying message is genuine appreciation for the people (or Janets) who hold everything together. End with Janet realizing she LIKES being helpful - it's not a burden, it's who she is. Jason should need the most ridiculous things summoned.

# The Support Group

## Description
Michael has decided the humans need to attend a "Former Bad Place Candidates Support Group" where they share and process their worst moments from Earth. It's supposed to be therapeutic. Instead, it becomes a competition. Who was actually the WORST person?

Competitive confessing ensues.

## Objectives
1. Each character shares progressively worse things they did on Earth
2. It becomes weirdly competitive - who was the biggest garbage person?
3. Genuine vulnerability emerges beneath the comedy
4. Explore how shame becomes armor
5. End with acceptance of their flawed pasts

## Key Beats
1. Michael: "Welcome to the support group. Who wants to share first?" Silence.
2. Eleanor starts small: "I once pretended I didn't see my roommate crying."
3. Tahani: "Oh that's nothing. I threw a fundraiser for orphans just to upstage Kamilah. I used orphans as PROPS."
4. Jason: "I once told my nana I'd visit her and then I didn't for three years."
5. Everyone: "...that's pretty bad, Jason."
6. Chidi: "I once spent so long choosing a wedding present that I missed the wedding AND the divorce."
7. Eleanor, escalating: "I got a coworker fired because she ate my yogurt."
8. Tahani: "I donated to a hospital just so they'd name a wing after me and NOT Kamilah."
9. Jason wins unexpectedly: "I accidentally set my dance crew on fire. Twice. Different crews."
10. They realize they're all terrible. It's weirdly bonding. "We're all garbage!" "Yeah, but we're garbage TOGETHER."

## Tone Guidelines
This should feel like a therapy session that goes off the rails into comedy. The competition aspect is funny but the underlying truth is real - these are people grappling with genuine regret. The humor comes from one-upmanship, but the heart comes from mutual acceptance. By the end, being able to laugh at their worst selves is actually healing. Michael should be a bewildered therapist who lost control of the session.
